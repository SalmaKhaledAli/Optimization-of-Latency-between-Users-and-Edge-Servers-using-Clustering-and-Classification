# Optimization-of-Latency-between-Users-and-Edge-Servers-using-Clustering-and-Classification

This project presents a novel approach for optimizing edge network performance using machine learning techniques, demonstrated through a series of experiments. The objective was to improve network efficiency by leveraging analytics to identify reliable and low-latency network paths for user traffic. The initial phase involved the utilization of agglomerative clustering and k-means clustering to partition the regionâ€™s data points into smaller, neighboring groups or areas. In the subsequent phase, the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm was employed to accurately assign each user to the optimal cluster based on proximity to edge resources. The results
indicated that k-means clustering exhibited superior performance with accuracy 99% compared to agglomerative clustering with accuracy 52%, although further optimization is recommended to enhance its reliability.
